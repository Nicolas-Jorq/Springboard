# Springboard

## 1. Python Projects
#### London Buroughs Data - Data Wrangling
- Tools utilized in this project include: pandas, matplotlib, fundamental data types, dictionaries, handling dates and times, function definition, default arguments, variable, length, and scope lambda functions and error handling 

#### API Project
- Utilized the Qunadl API. Qaundl is currently the most widely used aggregator of financial market data.

## 2. Python Statistics - EDA
#### Integrating Apps - Hypothesis Testing
- Analyzed whether there is a significant difference between the ratings on these two platforms that would justify choosing one over the other, by utilizing Hypothesis Testing. 

#### Frequentist Interferance
- Pythonic implementation of the concepts underlying frequentist inference, including z-statistic, Central Limit Theorem, Hypothesis Testing, and confidence intervals. Apllied tse implementations to a real-world study.

#### Linear Regression
- Linear regression is a paradigm of statistical modeling that has seen a huge resurgence in popularity recently. Therefore in this case study we utilize this model that explores which red wines have properties that make them more alcoholic.

#### SQL Case Study

## 3. Supervised Machine Learning
#### Logistic Regression
- Utilized logistic regression to create a model

#### Decision Trees
- Used scikitlearn to build four different decision tree models — two using entropy and two using gini impurity — to ascertain whether a potentially business-transforming deal. Used random forest to increase predictive accuracy and control overfitting

#### Random Forest
- Used Random Forest and logistic regression to understand the scope of the Coronavirus using data from December and January of 2020.

#### Ensemble Method - Gradient Boosting
- Used gradient boostings to improve predictions based on information from the residuals. First applied this method to a regression problem then to a classification problem using the Titanic dataset.

## 4. Unsupervised Machine Learning
#### Customer Segmentation using Clustering: K-means
- In this case study, you will implement the K-Means clustering algorithm, find the value for K using the Elbow method, the Silhouette method, and the Gap statistic, and visualize the clusters with Principal Components Analysis (PCA)


## 5. Model Evaluation - Optimization
#### Customer Segmentation using Clustering: K-means
- This case study uses grid searches to identify the optimal parameters for a machine learning algorithm. To complete this case study, we use the Pima Indian diabetes dataset from Kaggle and KNN.

#### Bayesian Optimization
- In this case study, we will be using the BayesianOptimization library to perform hyperparmater tuning. Also utilized LightGBM, a gradient boosting framework that uses tree-based learning algorithms.

## 6 - Data Storytelling
- An important aspect of Data Science is presenting your findings. In this study we create an engaging story around an animal shelter dataset to influence individuals next time they're looking for a pet.

## 7 - Time Series Analysis
#### Cowboy Cigarettes: A Time Series Investigation
- Used 1949-1960 data to predict whether the manufacturer's cigarette sales actually increased, decreased, or stayed the same in the early 60s. Using this data we made a probable reconstruction of the sales record of the manufacturer - predicting the future, from the perspective of the past.
