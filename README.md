### 1. Python Projects
London Buroughs Data - Data Wrangling
- Tools utilized in this project include: pandas, matplotlib, fundamental data types, dictionaries, handling dates and times, function definition, default arguments, variable, length, and scope lambda functions and error handling 

API Project
- Utilized the Qunadl API. Qaundl is currently the most widely used aggregator of financial market data.

### 2. Python Statistics - EDA
Integrating Apps - Hypothesis Testing
- nalyze whether there is a significant difference between the ratings on these two platforms that would justify choosing one over the other, by utilizing Hypothesis Testing. 

Frequentist Interferance
- Pythonic implementation of the concepts underlying frequentist inference, including z-statistic, Central Limit Theorem, Hypothesis Testing, and confidence intervals. Apllied tse implementations to a real-world study.

Linear Regression
- Linear regression is a paradigm of statistical modeling that has seen a huge resurgence in popularity recently. Therefore in this case study we utilize this model that explores which red wines have properties that make them more alcoholic.
